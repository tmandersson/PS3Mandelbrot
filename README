Alright now SPU's is used. Old threading code is removed.

A ton more clean up should be done. But I might have lost interest
at this point. It was fun to play around with this from time to time
as exercise. But it might be time I move on to something that has
higher value...

Anyone looking at my code or commit log should take it for what it is.
Hackfest/learning/duct-tape code. Whole thing can be simplified
to a lot fewer moving objects. Pointless design is left from what
I used as a starting point. (Old highschool code.)

Was cool to see that it was not impossible to get those SPU's
working and getting hot though. :)
